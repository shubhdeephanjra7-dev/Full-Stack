# SkillMate API

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080`. All endpoints except register/login/logout require the HttpOnly `sm_token` cookie.
Every POST/PUT/DELETE must send the header `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` (CSRF defence). Send requests with credentials.

Errors: `{ timestamp, status, error, message, fieldErrors? }`. Codes: 400 validation, 401 not logged in / expired, 403 forbidden, 404 not found (also used for other users' records), 409 conflict.

## Business rules
- Progress: NOT_STARTED = 0%, COMPLETED = 100%, IN_PROGRESS = solved/total questions of the skill (clamped 1-99%, 50% if the skill has no questions). Recording an attempt moves NOT_STARTED to IN_PROGRESS and recalculates unless COMPLETED.
- Weak: started skill below 40%. Strong: 70% or more. Skills with no progress record (or NOT_STARTED) are "not assessed", never weak.
- Readiness: subject = average of its skills' percentages (missing = 0%); overall = average of subjects that have skills; `NOT_ASSESSED` when nothing has been started. It is an estimate, not a guarantee.
